What does *'small open economy'* mean?
Economists rely on different criteria (e.g. Income Level, Human Development, Natural Resource Richness etc.) to classify the world's economies. Sometimes they use more than one criterion to think about a group of countries. In the literature on *International Macro* a large number of countries are considered as Small Open Economies (SOEs hereafter). So, what does it mean for a country to be a SOE? How does it matter to be such? And what are the main features of these SOEs?   
According to Guerron-Quintana (2013), ?a country is considered a small open economy when it takes as given the interest rate on its debt? p.10. A *SOE* is SMALL enough to lack any influence on the international market of debt. In this regard, the concept of SOE is very close to a fundamental assumption in Microeconomics. In a perfectly competitive market, firms are **price-takers**: there is a large number of small firms so that no firm can dictate or even influence the market price. From this perspective, assuming that the international market of debt is a perfectly competitive market, it can be concluded that SOEs are also price (interest rate) takers.


In addition, the smallness of an economy is reflected by its weight in the world output. The GDP of a SOE as a fraction of world output is low compared to that of large economies (such as the US, Japan, Germany). For instance, while the GDP of Germany[^1] represents 5.42 percent of the world output, Morocco’s GDP accounts for 0.16 percent only2. It worth pointing out that a country does not need to have a large surface area and/or population to be classified as a large economy, and vice versa. For example, the GDP (as share of world output) of Bangladesh, which is one of the most populous countries in the world, is only 0.31 percent, far less than that of Germany- a country whose population is about 82 million only.

A country’s degree of openness is multifaceted. First, the distinction between current account openness and financial (capital) account openness is crucial. The current account openness refers to the removal of restrictions and barriers on international exchange of goods and services. And the capital account openness indicates the liberalization of international trade on financial assets. During the last three decades, the trade liberalization1 has gained momentum among both academia and policymakers around the world. However, this consensus is facing a strong challenge these days (consider the position of US President, D. Trump for example).

In contrast to the trade liberalization, there is no such a consensus regarding the capital account openness. The reasons for this fact is that the effects of the capital account liberalization are ambiguous. For instance, in 2001, Barry Eichengreen wrote that “Capital account liberalization …remains one of the most controversial and least understood policies of our day”(Eichengreen, 2001). 

The second differentiation relevant to the degree of openness is between the de jure and de facto openness. On one hand, the de jure measures of the openness are based on the legal restrictions a country’s authorities apply on cross-border transactions. For example, the de jure measures of financial openness are usually based on international financial flows restrictions that the IMF records in its Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER). On the other hand, the de facto measures gauge the actual amounts of cross-border flows regardless of the statuary restrictions. For instance, is the indictor for trade openness the widely used in the literature, and it is a de facto indicator. The de facto capital account openness the most used in the recent literature is , which is conceived by (Lane & Milesi-ferretti, 2006).

Not all countries are small open economies. Indeed, a small number of countries are classified as large closed economies. These countries are considered to be LARGE for two reasons: they have a control over the interest rate on their debt and the weights of their outputs on the world output are relatively high. However, these large economies are not literally closed but their de facto degree of openness is rather low. In other words, the international trade does not count for much in their GDP (e.g. US, Japan). Moreover, according to Guerron-Quintana, Germany is the only economy that is both large and open. It is, therefore, a large open economy.
