**MILWAUKEE, WI** – Saturday, May 5th, 2018 returning from a one-week service-learning trip to Williamson, WV to Milwaukee, WI I had a four-hour layover in Charlotte, NC. I opened my laptop and searched for Loretta Lynn, a singer that Katy, a young woman from Kentucky I have met during my trip, told me was one of the most famous singers from Appalachia. The first video YouTube suggested to me was the song titled “Coal Miner’s Daughter”. The second strophe of the song says:

>*"Yeah, I’m proud to be a coal miner’s daughter
>I remember well – the well where I drew water
>The work we done was hard
>At night we’d sleep ’cause we worked hard
>I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler"*

   (Loretta Lynn, Coal Miner’s Daughter, 1970)

In “Coal Miner’s Daughter” Loretta Lynn tells the story of her life in Appalachia, having been born and grown up there. Although I have spent only seven days in Williamson, WV, the heart of Appalachia, I feel I also have a story to tell about the town.

Indeed, my service-learning trip to Williamson has been a firsthand experience of sustainable development matters. Williamson used to be an economic success-story when the coal mining was flourishing. I have been told that youth would not even consider their plan after high school. That was obvious: they will become coal miners and make enough money to acquire a house and build a family. Life was prosperous in Williamson. Nobody thought of ever leaving the heart of Appalachia.

However, the prosperity in Williamson was not sustainable. The town suffered tremendous economic loses as the coal-mining industry start to slowdown. The once thriving coal-mining town of 50 000 inhabitants is now a small community of around 3000 residents, struggling to survive.

Sunday, my first day in Williamson, with the other Fulbright-Amizade volunteers, we went hiking in the mountains. In the heart of Appalachia, the gorgeous green forests dominate the landscape, and the Tug river surrounds the town. It seemed like heaven on earth. From the top of a mountain, the town looks stagnant, though: It appears that everybody has left the heart of Appalachia.

The Economics story of Williamson is not unusual. As an Economics student, I learned that with technology and trade, one should never sleep like a dog. Things change, and sometimes very quickly. When things change, economists recommend a ruthless answer: the labor force should get trained for a new economic activity – Forget the old business. In Williamson, coal mining is not merely a business, though; it is a culture. In the heart of Appalachia, people are proud of being coal miners, sons and daughters of coal miners. In the heart of Appalachia, people talk about coal mining all day long. And in the heart of Appalachia, people sing about coal mining.  Life in the heart of Appalachia has been shaped by coal mining.

Besides the economic downturn, Williamson suffers also from a number of social and health issues. For instance, opioid addiction, diabetes and obesity are widespread. All ailments in Williamson seem to be related to the decline of coal mining. During our visit to the Williamson Health and Wellness (WHW) center, I was surprised by Darrin’s (the Executive Assistant/Community Liaison at WHW) answer to a question raised by a fellow Fulbright-Amizade participant about the major health issues that the Williamson community undergoes. “Unemployment” was Darrin’s short answer. Indeed, Darrin emphasized that drug treatment, for example, can only be effective when patients anticipate a better life, which starts with finding a job.

I brought up the “forget the old business” story to a few people in Williamson. David, a young man who worked in the coal mining for a period of time but is currently pursuing a college degree in nursing, told me “This could work!”.  James, who is much older than David, works for Refresh Appalachia, a nonprofit organization that promote local food economy, could not give a short answer. We were working on a surface mining that James and his crew aspire to transform into an active agriculture farm. He suggested moving to the comfortable seats of his truck in order to talk about the change in the heart of Appalachia. Only then I did understand how arduous this change was.

Nevertheless, the community leaders I have met in Williamson are committed to a mission, which is to create a sustainable community in Williamson. They struggle to diversify the community’s economy through projects which aim to build a sustainable agriculture, promote renewable energy and initiate a sustainable tourism. The leaders also educate the community about eating healthy and encourage them to exercise. The leaders in Williamson not only seek to perpetuate the town but strive to make it a better place.

I asked Darrin if he would like his children to settle down in the small town of Williamson. I was expecting the answer to be delicate for him. In fact, it was not. Darrin looked forward to seeing his children thrive in their home town. He told me that, for him, the American dream is to live, work hard and raise a good family in a small community such as Williamson.

Throughout the one-week service-learning experience in the heart of Appalachia, I have had the chance, with the other Fulbright-Amizade participants, to work closely with the local community. For instance, we prepared the soil for planting in the Williamson community gardens, refresh Appalachiafarm and sustainable Pikeville. We also helped the Starrs, an elderly couple, to plant corn, onions and tomato. I was delighted to learn that the work we had done in a few hours would have taken the Starrs three days to accomplish. But what we have learned from this experience was far more valuable than the labor we provided.

Coal mining has shaped life in Williamson since its birth. However, as Loretta Lynn song says, a lot of things have changed since way back then. The coal mining business has collapsed. Now, Williamson struggles to redefine itself. I can only imagine how painful it is to find a new identity. Nevertheless, the community leaders I have met during my service-learning trip are confident to make Williamson a great place, and that the prosperity will sustain in the heart of Appalachia.

Saturday morning, it was raining, we left the heart of Appalachia. I brought with me a thought-provoking story, that of Williamson, a small town in West Virginia. A number of stories have been told about the town. I will eagerly follow the story of sustainable Williamson.
