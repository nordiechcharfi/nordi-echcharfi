It has always been a dream of mine to study in the United States.
When I discovered the Fulbright Program, I began to work towards
this goal by enrolling in English courses to improve my English
and get a high score on the TOEFL. I discovered something fascinating
with mastering the English language. That is, if you are curious enough,
you can acquire knowledge on literally any subject or field. The internet
provides an astonishing amount of resources and materials in English, for free.
Reading in English has not only increased my knowledge in my discipline of study,
Economics, but has also broadened my area of research.

Having goals like Fulbright has pushed me to stay focused on my daily work activities.
I stayed motivated by always reminding myself to be “good enough.” Good enough to get into
a PhD program in Morocco, then ultimately to be eligible to apply for the Fulbright Joint
Supervision grant. My hard work paid off- I graduated as valedictorian of my class in
October 2015. I was accepted into the PhD research program in Economics at Mohammed-V
University in January 2016. My first goal was successful because of Fulbright.

For those who have a mission, never give up! The Fulbright scholarship was my mission
and it inspired me to keep going until I achieved my goal. Last year, I went through some
hardships and started to lack motivation for everything except my goal to become
a Fulbrighter. I stayed focused and it helped me to overcome the obstacles in my life.
My hard work paid off and I was selected in 2017 for the Fulbright Joint Supervision award
to conduct research on economics at University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee.
Now, I am a Fulbrighter, a dream come true!


I arrived in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in August and have been astonished by how compassionate
people are here.. When I first arrived at the airport, I met my advisor, Rebecca,
who helped me move into my new apartment. She even provided me with almost all the kitchen items
I’ve been using so far.

Citizens of Milwaukee are really friendly. Even when I struggled with the language,
they were always patient with me. It is becoming more natural for me to have causal
conversations with folks I come across. For instance, my second day in Milwaukee,
I was heading to my apartment with pizza I bought for dinner. A man headed towards
me asked, “Hey…pizza! Where did you get it?” I told him I purchased it from Ian’s Pizza.
That was the outset of a conversion about where one can get good pizza in Milwaukee that
lasted a couple of minutes.

It has been about three months since I arrived in the United States, and now Milwaukee
feels like home. I have been invited by many American friends to join their weekend
activities, and I have invited some of them to a Moroccan dinner. I am also involved
with a soccer team called UWM Internationals, and I believe that we have been the best
team so far. I’m already settling in and I’m excited for what the rest of my Fulbright
experience will bring me.
